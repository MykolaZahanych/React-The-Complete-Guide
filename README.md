I have a habit of buying an updated course on react every year and refreshing my knowledge of this technology. "Repetition is the mother of learning" or "Tutorials hell"? In any case, here you can find projects from this course and my improvements.

Сourse: [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Academind, Maximilian Schwarzmüller. Thanks for the great content!
